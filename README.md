# CannonWilson.github.io

This is the code for my personal website, which is accessible from CannonWilson.com via DNS forwarding.

This site is made using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I have implemented the following features:
- CSS Bootstrap for formatting
- Horizontal scrolling
- Triggering CSS animations using the intersection observer API
- Pausing and playing gifs on hover
